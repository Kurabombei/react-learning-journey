## React docs/Chapter 1. Describing the UI
React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and
images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components. From websites to phone apps, everything on the
screen can be broken down into components. In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn to create, customize, and conditionally
display React components.
